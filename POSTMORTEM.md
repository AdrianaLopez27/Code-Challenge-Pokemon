# Postmortem documentation

## Chronogram of the project
- Start: 15/May/2024
- Finalización: 19/May/2024

## Summary

The project consisted of developing a web application that uses the Pokémon public API to extract data and build a web application with at least two main screens. One screen shows a list of Pokémon retrieved from the API and local storage, while the other provides a detailed view of each Pokémon. In addition, CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations were implemented that allowed the management of Pokémon.

## Goals
* Public API Data Extraction: Use the Pokémon API to get Pokémon data and display it in a web application.
* Screen Implementation: displaying a list of Pokémon, providing a detailed view of each Pokémon
* CRUD Operations: Allow users to create, read, update and remove Pokémon from the list.
* Comprehensive Testing: Ensure thorough testing of the application to demonstrate a basic understanding of testing principles.

## Achievements
* API Data Extraction: Data extraction from the Pokémon API has been successfully implemented.
* Screens Implemented: Two main screens were developed: one for the Pokémon list and another for the detailed view.
* CRUD Operations: CRUD operations have been implemented to manage Pokémon.

## Difficulties encountered
- Not having much experience in the QA area
- During development, having a problem with assigning an ID that was unique to the pokemon that are created

## Learned lessons
* Correct assignment of unique IDs is essential for managing elements in CRUD applications.

## Future Steps
* Improvements in the user's interface
* Test Automation: Implement a set of automated tests to ensure code quality.

## Conclution
The project achieved its main goals, providing a functional web application that combines data from a public API and local storage, with CRUD operations. The lessons learned and future steps will help further improve web application development in the future.
